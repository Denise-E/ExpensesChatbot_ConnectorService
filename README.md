# ExpensesChatbot_ConnectorService

ExpensesChatbot_ConnectorService serves as the integration layer between the Telegram API and the core Bot Service. It is responsible for receiving incoming messages from users via Telegram, forwarding those messages to the Bot Service for processing, and returning the corresponding responses back to the users. Built with Node.js using the Telegraf and Express frameworks, it communicates with the Python-based Bot Service over HTTP, acting as the bridge between the user interface and the backend logic for expense management.

- **Axios**: HTTP client for sending requests to the BotService.

## Running the Project

### Clone the repository

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed on your system (LTS version recommended).

### üíæ Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### .env Variables

Create a .env file in the root directory with the following content:

TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token
BOT_SERVICE_URL=bot_service_url

### üöÄ Run the Project

#### Development mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

#### Production mode

```bash
npm run start
```

### ü§ñ How It Works

Unlike traditional REST APIs, this service doesn't expose public endpoints. Instead, it passively listens to incoming messages sent to a Telegram bot.

To set up your bot:

1. Open Telegram and search for [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather).
2. Start a chat and use the `/newbot` command to create a new bot.
3. Follow the prompts to give your bot a name and username.
4. Once created, BotFather will provide you with a **bot token**.
5. Copy this token and paste it into your `.env` file under the `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` variable.

The ConnectorService uses the **Telegraf** framework to define how the bot should react to specific commands received from users. It currently supports the following commands:

- `/start`: Greets the user and confirms the bot is active.
- `/upload`: Allows users to submit a free-form message describing an expense. This message is sent to the BotService for analysis, classification, and storage.
- `/get`: Requests a list of all expenses recorded by the user.

These interactions allow users to manage their expenses directly from Telegram, with the ConnectorService acting as the bridge between Telegram and the core business logic implemented in the Python-based BotService.
